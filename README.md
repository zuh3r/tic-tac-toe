# Tic Tac Toe

Mortal Kombat theme on the classic TicTacToe game

## Approach to problem (planning)

I had broken down the mechanics of tic tac toe into simple steps to solve, not focussing on game design or theme.

Once I had laid out the steps, I began by creating my main game screen on HTML with basic CSS and adding JavaScript functionality. Once I had a working tic tac toe game, I had physically drawn out a layout and began adding a Mortal Kombat theme (background, 'fatality' popup, 'fight/finish him' message on player turn, background audio) styling fonts, adding a win counter and finally adding a intro + winner screen as separate secions in the HTML.

## Cool tech used

'fight' function used which flashes "Fight" on the player whose turn it is. If player had two wins, this switched to a "Finish Him" message.
